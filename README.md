Hello, 
My name is Yash Bansal.

I have created a portfolio which contains an about, hobbies and skills section.
Deployment -> https://wonderful-elion-eae6c4.netlify.app/        

Some Features about my portfolio :-
1. I have not used any kind of framework and library to implement this project. It is made up purely of HTML, CSS and Javascript only.
2. I made sure that website remain responsive even on small screen devices by using help of media query
3. It contains a background music (Song Name -> Warriyo - Mortals (feat. Laura Brehm)) which is autoplayed when the webpage is loaded. In some browser, you may have to manually start the audio by clicking on music button present in bottom left part of screen due to some browser policy. For more details: https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/
4. I have also made a preloader completely from CSS. 



Additional Features which can be added in future :-
1. My work section where i can display my projects
2. My experience section
3. Connect with me section 
and many more...

I hope you like my project
